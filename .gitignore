# Best practice is to not commit the vendor directory. instead, commit the
# composer.lock file and run `composer install` on the server.
/vendor

# Downloading a local copy of composer.phar on the live server environment is
# usually a good idea as well.
composer.phar

# Depending on your workflow you may want to add additional paths to gitignore.
# If you use grunt/gulp or something similar to compile assets, you may want to
# add directories under public/ here. It's all up to you.
